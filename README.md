# lin513

The aim of this program is to predict lexical complexity of single words in context. It collects a series of features and trains a regression model (using Ridge regularization) to predict complexities of words in another subset of data.

## Data
The dataset consists of a subset of the CompLex corpus (Shardlow, Cooper and Zampieri, 2020) and was provided as part of the SemEval 2021 (Task 1). The data consists of a collection of sentences from multiple domains and for each sentence there is a chosen target word. The sentences' target words are annotated using a 5-point Likert scale (1 very easy – 5 very difficult), and then normalized to a 0 – 1 scale (0 being the least difficult). 

Training and test files are tab separated (.tsv) and follow the following column structure:
1. Sentence/token ID
2. Domain (e.g. bible, europarl, biomed)
3. Sentence
4. Target word
5. Complexity

## Usage

All methods are called through main.py.
