# lin513

The aim of this program is to predict lexical complexity of single words in context.

## Data
The dataset is provided as part of the SemEval 2021 (Task 1) and consists of a collection
of sentences from multiple domains. The sentences' target words are annotated using a 5-point Likert scale (1 very easy â€“ 5 very difficult). Training and test files are tab separated (.tsv) and follow the following structure:
    1. Sentence/token ID
    2. Domain (e.g.: bible, europarl, biomed)
    3. Sentence
    4. Target word
    5. Complexity
