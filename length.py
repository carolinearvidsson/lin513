class Length():
    '''Is a word length (character) and syllable count calculator. 
    Utilizes the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary (CMPD/cmudict) 
    to tokenize words on a phoneme level.
    
    Attributes:

        syll_dict (dict)
            the CMP dictionary with words as keys and pronounciation
            in list form as values. Some entries have alternative 
            pronounciations, in every case only the first one is used.
        
        observed_tokens (dict)
            contains all previously observed tokens as key and their
            word length and syllable count as values, as to avoid repetition.
