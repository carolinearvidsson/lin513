# Murathan: I loved this! However, it feels like you can only have one public method in the feature classes and that has to be used to generate features.
# Murathan: would not it be better to have a certain prefix for those functions (generate_feat_*) which you can use at line 46 so you can freely have other public methods.
# Murathan: It is a minor point, tho. Good work!

class FeatureMatrix:
    '''A feature matrix where rows represent target tokens and

    lexical complexity of target tokens.
    
    Parameters:

        ws (WS-object) 
            A collection of Word-objects, representing entries 
            in the CompLex corpus.
        
        fclasses (tuple)
            Contains the feature classes. Their public methods are
            called in order to retrieve features.
    
    Attributes:

        self.matrix (list of lists)
            Each nested list is a vector containing the features
            for a specific target word.

        self.complexities (list)
            Each element (float) is the annoteted complexity
            for a specific target word.
